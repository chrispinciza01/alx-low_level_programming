# Dynamic libraries

# Learning Objectives

* What is a dynamic library, how does it work, how to create one, and how to use it
* What is the environment variable `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and how to use it
* What are the differences between static and shared libraries
* Basic usage `nm`, `ldd`, `ldconfig`

# Tasks

## A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life

Create the dynamic library libholberton.so containing all the functions listed below:

```
int _putchar(char c);
int _islower(int c);
int _isalpha(int c);
int _abs(int n);
int _isupper(int c);
int _isdigit(int c);
int _strlen(char *s);
void _puts(char *s);
char *_strcpy(char *dest, char *src);
int _atoi(char *s);
char *_strcat(char *dest, char *src);
char *_strncat(char *dest, char *src, int n);
char *_strncpy(char *dest, char *src, int n);
int _strcmp(char *s1, char *s2);
char *_memset(char *s, char b, unsigned int n);
char *_memcpy(char *dest, char *src, unsigned int n);
char *_strchr(char *s, char c);
unsigned int _strspn(char *s, char *accept);
char *_strpbrk(char *s, char *accept);
char *_strstr(char *haystack, char *needle);
```

If you haven’t coded all of the above functions create empty ones, with the right prototype.
Don’t forget to push your `holberton.h` file in your repository, containing at least all the prototypes of the above functions.

## Code injection: Win the Giga Millions!

I bought a ticket for the Giga Millions and chose these numbers: 9, 8, 10, 24, 75 + 9. If you could run two commands on the same server where the Giga Millions program runs, could you make me win the Jackpot?

* Our mole got us a copy of the program, you can download it [here](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x18.c). Our mole also gave us a piece of documentation:

```
/* Giga Millions program                                                                                    
  * Players may pick six numbers from two separate pools of numbers:                                                
  * - five different numbers from 1 to 75 and                                                                       
  * - one number from 1 to 15                                                                                       
  * You win the jackpot by matching all six winning numbers in a drawing.                                           
  * Your chances to win the jackpot is 1 in 258,890,850                                                             
  *                                                                                           

  * usage: ./gm n1 n2 n3 n4 n5 bonus
```

* You can’t modify the program `gm` itself as Master Sysadmin Sylvain (MSS) always checks its [MD5](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x18.c/blob/master/101-md5_gm) before running it
* The system is an `Linux Ubuntu 16.04`
* The server has internet access
* Our mole will be only able to run two commands from a shell script, without being detected by MSS
* Your shell script should be maximum 3 lines long. You are not allowed to use `;`, `&&`, `||`, `|`, `\`` (it would be detected by MSS), and have a maximum of two commands
* Our mole has only the authorization to upload one file on the server. It will be your shell script
* Our mole will run your shell script this way: `mss@gm_server$ . ./101-make_me_win.sh`
* Our mole will run your shell script from the same directory containing the program `gm`, exactly 98 seconds before MSS runs `gm` with my numbers: `./gm 9 8 10 24 75 9`
* MSS will use the same terminal and session than our mole
* Before running the `gm` program, MSS always check the content of the directory
* MSS always exit after running the program `gm`
* TL;DR; This is what is going to happen

```
